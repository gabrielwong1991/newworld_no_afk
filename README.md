Very useful at the moment when queue times to server is high

To use this script you will need python with administrator access

Install the following packages in python:
pip install pywinauto==0.6.6
pip install pyautogui
pip install keyboard

Change the parameters of the script
`TimeDelayBetweenAction` is the delay between an action
`keypress` is a list of keyboard key you want to press


To run the script simply open up CMD or Anaconda and type:

Happy gaming!
