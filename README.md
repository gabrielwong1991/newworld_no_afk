A very simple script to avoid getting kick out of server for AFK

Very useful at the moment when queue times to server is high

To use this script you will need python with administrator access

Install the following packages in python:

pip install pywinauto==0.6.6

pip install pyautogui

pip install keyboard

Change the parameters of the script to your liking:

`TimeDelayBetweenAction` is the delay between an action (in seconds, currently is `5` seconds)

`keypress` is a list of keyboard key you want to press (Currently `a`, `s`, `d`, `f`)


To run the script simply open up CMD or Anaconda and type while in game:

python <file_location>new_world_no_afk.py


Exit the script by spamming "ctrl + c" or alt+tab to close the CMD window


Happy gaming!
